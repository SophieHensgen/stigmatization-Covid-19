            Objective
            Determine age-specific infection fatality rates for COVID-19 to inform public health policies and communications that help protect vulnerable age groups.
          
          
            Methods
            Studies of COVID-19 prevalence were collected by conducting an online search of published articles, preprints, and government reports that were publicly disseminated prior to 18 September 2020. The systematic review encompassed 113 studies, of which 27 studies (covering 34 geographical locations) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with reported fatalities four weeks after the midpoint date of the study, reflecting typical lags in fatalities and reporting. Meta-regression procedures in Stata were used to analyze the infection fatality rate (IFR) by age.
          
          
            Results
            Our analysis finds a exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002\% at age 10 and 0.01\% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4\% at age 55, 1.4\% at age 65, 4.6\% at age 75, and 15\% at age 85. Moreover, our results indicate that about 90\% of the variation in population IFR across geographical locations reflects differences in the age composition of the population and the extent to which relatively vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus.
          
          
            Discussion
            These results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. Moreover, the overall IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths.},

                Survey of adults (

              Results
              Respondents commonly perceived people with schizophrenia, alcoholism and drug addiction as unpredictable and dangerous. The two latter conditions were also viewed as self-inflicted. People with any of the seven disorders were perceived as hard to talk with. Opinions about effects of treatment and prognosis suggested reasonable knowledge. About half the respondents reported knowing someone with a mental illness.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Negative opinions indiscriminately overemphasise social handicaps that can accompany mental disorders. They contribute to social isolation, distress and difficulties in employment faced by sufferers. A campaign against stigma should take account of the differences in opinions about the seven disorders studied.},

	abstract = {In Austria, 12\% of all students in higher education report a disability that, at least somewhat, limits their study activities. As they still face many barriers throughout their studies, support services play a key part in their academic success. However, data from the Austrian Student Social Survey demonstrate that every second student with a disability is reluctant to contact fellow students, lecturers, or institutional support in case of study-related difficulties. One in four students with disabilities does not seek any assistance because of stigmatisation fear. With respect to these tendencies, our article examines factors that promote or inhibit the reluctance of students with disabilities to seek support due to fear of stigmatisation. For this purpose, we construct a binary indicator of stigma fear, which encompasses items concerning social isolation or drawbacks to academic opportunities, inhibitions about contacting people or disclosing one’s disability. In a regression model, we identify influential factors such as noticeability of disability and degree of study-related limitations as well as social factors like the feeling of anonymity and sense of belonging.},

              Conclusions
              Based on the structure of stigmatisation one could explore six levels of intervention in anti-stigmatisation campaigns: the cognitive level – educational intervention; the affective level – psychological intervention; the discrimination level – legislative intervention; the denial level – linguistic intervention; the economic origin – political intervention; the evolutionary origin – intellectual and cultural intervention. As destigmatisation has to challenge fundamental human tendencies, anti-stigmatisation campaigns have to be continuous, non-stop, open-ended projects aiming at keeping alive thought processes that moderate and humanise the pursuit of self-interest and the urge to survive in a competitive world.},

	abstract = {This investigation combined behavioral and functional neuroimaging measures to explore whether perception of pain is modulated by the target's stigmatized status and whether the target bore responsibility for that stigma. During fMRI scanning, participants were exposed to a series of short video clips featuring age-matched individuals experiencing pain who were (a) similar to the participant (healthy), (b) stigmatized but not responsible for their stigmatized condition (infected with AIDS as a result of an infected blood transfusion), or (c) stigmatized and responsible for their stigmatized condition (infected with AIDS as a result of intravenous drug use). Explicit pain and empathy ratings for the targets were obtained outside of the MRI environment, along with a variety of implicit and explicit measures of AIDS bias. Results showed that participants were significantly more sensitive to the pain of AIDS transfusion targets as compared with healthy and AIDS drug targets, as evidenced by significantly higher pain and empathy ratings during video evaluation and significantly greater hemodynamic activity in areas associated with pain processing (i.e., right anterior insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray). In contrast, significantly less activity was observed in the anterior midcingulate cortex for AIDS drug targets as compared with healthy controls. Further, behavioral differences between healthy and AIDS drug targets were moderated by the extent to which participants blamed AIDS drug individuals for their condition. Controlling for both explicit and implicit AIDS bias, the more participants blamed these targets, the less pain they attributed to them as compared with healthy controls. The present study reveals that empathic resonance is moderated early in information processing by a priori attitudes toward the target group.},

            This article explores the relationship between crises and democracy through a focus on the unfolding coronavirus pandemic. Its central argument is that to interpret the current pandemic purely in terms of its epidemiology and public health implications risks overlooking its potentially more significant socio-political consequences. This is because the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis have themselves become overlaid or layered-upon a pre-existing set of concerns regarding the performance, efficiency and capacity of democratic political structures. The aim of this article is to try and understand and warn against what might be termed a rather odd form of cross-contamination whereby the cynicism, negativity and frustration concerning politicians, political processes and political institutions that existed before the coronavirus outbreak is allowed to direct, define and automatically devalue how democratic structures are subsequently judged in terms of how they responded to the challenge. As such, this article focuses on the link between the Coronavirus crisis and the democratic crisis; or, more precisely, the risk that the Coronavirus crisis may mutate into and fuel a broader crisis of democracy.},

	abstract = {The novel coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage communities across the US. Opinion surveys identified importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. Here, we use social media data to study complexity of polarization. We analyze a large dataset of tweets related to the pandemic collected between January and May of 2020, and develop methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative) and science (anti-science vs pro-science) dimensions. While polarization along the science and political dimensions are correlated, politically moderate users are more likely to be aligned with the pro-science views, and politically hardline users with anti-science views. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that polarization grows over time; instead, we see increasing activity by moderate pro-science users. We also show that anti-science conservatives tend to tweet from the Southern US, while anti-science moderates from the Western states. Our findings shed light on the multi-dimensional nature of polarization, and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data.},

We trained machine learning-based classifiers using a few different methods and tested how well they performed different tasks. For polarity classification, we tested a cross-domain strategy in order to measure the performance of the classifiers among different domains. For fine-grained opinion identification, we provide a taxonomy of opinion aspects and employed them in conjunction with machine learning methods. Based on the obtained results, we found that the cross-domain data improved the results of the polarity classification. For fine-grained opinion identification, the use of a domain taxonomy presented competitive results for the Portuguese language.},

	abstract = {Anti-Asian discrimination and assaults have increased significantly during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, contributing to a “secondary contagion” of racism. The United States has a long and well-documented history of both interpersonal and structural anti-Asian discrimination, and the current pandemic reinforces longstanding negative stereotypes of this rapidly growing minority group as the “Yellow Peril.”
            We provide a general overview of the history of anti-Asian discrimination in the United States, review theoretical and empirical associations between discrimination and health, and describe the associated public health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, citing relevant evidence from previous disasters in US history that became racialized.
            Although the literature suggests that COVID-19 will likely have significant negative effects on the health of Asian Americans and other vulnerable groups, there are reasons for optimism as well. These include the emergence of mechanisms for reporting and tracking incidents of racial bias, increased awareness of racism’s insidious harms and subsequent civic and political engagement by the Asian American community, and further research into resilience-promoting factors that can reduce the negative health effects of racism.},

We arrive at two conclusions. First, the two sets of models have much in common (representing "one animal"); most differences are a matter of focus and emphasis. Second, one important distinction is in the type of human characteristics that are the primary focus of models of prejudice (race) and stigma (deviant behavior and identities, and disease and disabilities). This led us to develop a typology of three functions of stigma and prejudice: exploitation and domination (keeping people down); norm enforcement (keeping people in); and disease avoidance (keeping people away). We argue that attention to these functions will enhance our understanding of stigma and prejudice and our ability to reduce them.},

	title = {Community perception of leprosy: {Baseline} assessment of perceptions – knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviour in {East}-{Java}, {Indonesia}.},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Background: {\textless}/strong{\textgreater}Global leprosy control has improved concerning detection in the community and better treatment adherence, yet leprosy remains endemic in many countries. Indonesia –with 17202 new cases in 2015 – ranks third after India and Brazil on the list of countries with the highest number of recorded new cases. Despite the existence of adequate treatment that addresses physical aspects of the disease, the stigma attached to leprosy has not been addressed sufficiently. Stigma results in negative perceptions, which in combination with a lack of knowledge affect awareness to act on symptoms and signs of leprosy{\textless}strong{\textgreater}. {\textless}/strong{\textgreater}Working towards eliminating leprosy-related stigma regarding persons affected by leprosy and their family members should be done with public education interventions suitable for the local context. For this, we need to understand the community perception of leprosy and people affected by leprosy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Research question {\textless}/strong{\textgreater}This study aims to gain insights into the community perceptions of leprosy and people affected by leprosy, in the Pasuruan district of East-Java as one of the steps towards eliminating leprosy-related stigma affecting persons with leprosy and their family members, through public education interventions suitable for the context of Pasuruan. Gaining insights into perceptions will be done through assessing knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviour of the community members regarding leprosy in Pasuruan, East Java, Indonesia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Methods: {\textless}/strong{\textgreater}A cross-sectional mixed-methods study was conducted among community members. The quantitative questionnaires used were: KAP, EMIC-CSS*, and Leprosy adjusted SDS* in the Pasuruan regency, East-Java, Indonesia. Stratified random sampling was used, resulting in the inclusion of 7 sub-regions in which five villages were sampled. In total 350 community members participated in the age range of 18-95. Furthermore, 12 qualitative semi-structured interviews were held with 6 community members and 6 contacts (people who are with leprosy patient over 30 hours per week) who were selected purposively. Data obtained was analysed using descriptive statistics of frequency, distribution tables, means and standard deviation. The knowledge level was calculated. High and low endemic regions were compared. Inferences from the qualitative results were analyzed and used to explain the quantitative results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Results: {\textless}/strong{\textgreater}The mean EMIC-CSS score was 15,64 (SD: 7,82, [min 0-max 30]). In total, 79,4\% of the participants scored above the minimum cut-off value of 8 points. The mean SDS score was 10,25 (SD: 5,31, [min 0-max 21]). Both scores were higher than, or comparable to previous measures in Indonesia, and indicated a high level of stigma in this community. Over half of the study population believed leprosy was a hereditary disorder, a belief that is likely to have a major impact on one’s social position with regards to marriage and family life. Besides that, people perceived leprosy as a disgusting shameful disease, and as a result sometimes discriminative safety measures were taken.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Discussion: {\textless}/strong{\textgreater}The PEP++ project should work together with local community offices, and nonformal education institutions to educate community members about the cause of leprosy. This activity would make their work more sustainable because the misconceptions found are mostly rooted in religious beliefs. Besides education about the cause, stereotypes of severe causes should be weakened. So-called champions could become overt advocates, as a sort of ‘living proof’ or ‘real life cases’ to tackle these negative perceptions and demonstrate the true nature of the disease with the power to change the taboo image of leprosy and negative attitudes from community with it.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aims.
              The current study aimed to: (i) describe the extent of overall stigma as well as the differences in stigma towards people with alcohol abuse, dementia, depression, schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder, as well as (ii) establish the dimensions of stigma and examine its correlates, in the general population of Singapore, using a vignette approach.
            
            
              Methods.
              Data for the current study came from a larger nation-wide cross-sectional study of mental health literacy conducted in Singapore. The study population comprised Singapore Residents (Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) aged 18–65 years who were living in Singapore at the time of the survey. All respondents were administered the Personal and Perceived scales of the Depression Stigma scale and the Social Distance scale to measure personal stigma and social distance, respectively. Weighted mean and standard error of the mean were calculated for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Exploratory structural equation modelling and confirmatory factor analysis were used to establish the dimensions of stigma. Multivariable linear regressions were conducted to examine factors associated with each of the stigma scale scores.
            
            
              Results.
              The mean age of the respondents was 40.9 years and gender was equally represented (50.9\% were males). The findings from the factor analysis revealed that personal stigma formed two distinct dimensions comprising ‘weak-not-sick’ and ‘dangerous/unpredictable’ while social distance stigma items loaded strongly into a single factor. Those of Malay and Indian ethnicity, lower education, lower income status and those who were administered the depression and alcohol abuse vignette were significantly associated with higher weak-not-sick scores. Those of Indian ethnicity, 6 years of education and below, lower income status and those who were administered the alcohol abuse vignette were significantly associated with higher dangerous/unpredictable scores. Those administered the alcohol abuse vignette were associated with higher social distance scores.
            
            
              Conclusion.
              This population-wide study found significant stigma towards people with mental illness and identified specific groups who have more stigmatising attitudes. The study also found that having a friend or family member with similar problems was associated with having lower personal as well as social distance stigma. There is a need for well-planned and culturally relevant anti-stigma campaigns in this population that take into consideration the findings of this study.},
